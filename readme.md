This is the result of forcing myself into writing a "perfect" bot to never lose in tic-tac-toe so I can grab to my sister.

For learning purposes I forced myself to implement the entirety of aurora-engine with 0 help, no chatgpt, no stackoverflow, nothing.

Do note though that I did make chatgpt write me the index.html and tictactoe.js (partly) as I wanted to speed up the creation of this

I had 0 google searches, and 0 other internet access during writing aurora-engine.js
Debugging was hell because I knew gpt could figure it out instantly, but I do like the challenge
I got stuck for a solid 30 minutes just because I had a return statement inside of the loop instead of ater it, that was fun :'3

Please do note that this is basically as inefficient as it gets, just for my purpose it works, as I've said in a code comment; "That is terribly inefficient, but I have a fast CPU and 0 fucks to give."

TLDR; Depressed programmer had nothing better to do than to code a tic-tac-toe bot from scratch with 0 references
